 "TCGA breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA) segmented copy number variation profile after removing common germline copy number variation.<br><br> Copy number profile was measured experimentally using the Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 platform at the Broad TCGA genome characterization center. Raw copy numbers were estimated at each of the SNP and copy-number markers. <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15475419\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Circular binary segmentation</u></a> was then used to segment the copy number data. Segments are mapped to hg19 genome assembly at Broad. A fixed set of common germline cnv probes were removed prior to segmentation.
