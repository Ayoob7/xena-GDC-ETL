 "description":
 "The gene expression profile was measured experimentally using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 RNA Sequencing platform by the University of North Carolina TCGA genome characterization center. Level 3 data was downloaded from TCGA data coordination center. This dataset shows the gene-level transcription estimates, as in log2(x+1) transformed RSEM normalized count. Genes are mapped onto the human genome coordinates using UCSC Xena HUGO probeMap (see ID/Gene mapping link below for details).

Users can view the original non-normalized values by adjusting visualization settings.<br><br>"}
